# Laravel Excel Report Automation
I discovered this project during my internship at BRI (Bank Rakyat Indonesia), where my daily tasks included developing a balance sheet analysis dashboard and a management website, along with adding automation features. I often assisted with manual, repetitive Excel tasks, which inspired me to create this project. Here, I automate these tasks while learning more about Laravel Excel.
